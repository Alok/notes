* Some files (blobs) are data files
* Some files (trees) are hierarchy - they specify the structure of
  the blobs, and how they connect to each other (like a database)
* Some files (commits) are snapshots of the arrangement of the
  blobs on the trees
* Some files (tags) hold metadata about the blobs
