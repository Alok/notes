# Git data organization / What's in a repo?

* DAG (.git/objects): data/contents
    * files never change, only added/removed
    * perfect use-case for hardlinks (local clone)
    * identical contents for all repo clones
* Config: Mnemonics! References to the DAG.
    * mutable files
    * per-user/clone
* Working copy: your playpen/sandbox/mess
    * files frequently change
    * totally irrelevant until `git add`

^^ Three kinds of repository stuff. ^^
   Only DAG matters. ("content addressable")
