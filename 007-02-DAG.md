# Git data organization / What's in a repo?

* DAG (.git/objects): the contents
    * files are never changed, only added/removed
    * perfect use-case for hardlinks (local clone)
    * identical contents for all repo clones
* Config: references to the DAG. Mnemonics!
    * mutable contents
    * potentially specific to each user/clone
* Working copy: your playpen/sandbox/mess
    * contents frequently change
    * totally irrelevant to git until `git add/status/checkout/diff`

^^ Three kinds of repository stuff. ^^
   Only DAG matters. ("content addressable")
