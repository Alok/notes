To see the sequences that your terminal is _actually_ sending:
    showkey -a

terminfo/termcap is a database that maps terminal inputs to terminal codes.
    `infocmp -L` prints out the current mappings.
    To see the mapping for `key_backspace`:
        infocmp -L | grep key_backspace
    To update a termcode mapping:
        1. Write a new terminfo file with the updated mapping:
            infocmp $TERM | sed 's/kbs=^[hH]/kbs=\\177/' > $TERM.ti
        2. Instruct the terminal to "recompile" its terminfo:
            tic $TERM.ti
