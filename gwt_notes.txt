UiBinder with 'html' tag is faster than a Widget
    - optimization: use HtmlPanel in UiBinder, fill it with raw HTML, then just use Widgets selectively
    - don't use Widgets unless you need to respond to an event from that Widget


CellTable
    cellTable.redraw() //redraws entire table, very fast, but...
    //redraw a single row is even faster, but be aware 
    //the user might delete a row and the index will be off
    cellTable.setRowData(index, Collections.singletonList(obj));
