  extended="Unicode defines an adequate character set but an unreasonable representation. / UTF-1 advantages: It is a byte encoding and is therefore byte-order independent. ASCII control characters appear in the byte stream only as themselves, never as an element of a sequence encoding another character, so newline bytes separate lines of UTF text. / UTF-1 major disadvantage: not self-synchronizing =&gt; cannot find the character boundaries in a UTF string without reading from the beginning. / &quot;The actual encoding is relatively unimportant to the software; the adoption of large characters and a byte-stream encoding per se are much deeper issues.&quot;"

  extended="Unicode is not an encoding. Unicode defines a table of code points for characters. The character ·∏Ä has the Unicode code point U+1E00. UTF-32 is an encoding that encodes all Unicode code points using 32 bits: 4 bytes per character. UTF-16 and UTF-8 are variable-length encodings. &quot;Unicode support&quot; in a programming language or OS is not necessary as long as the runtime treats a string input as a bit stream and does not attempt to manipulate it as a specific encoding. You only need to be careful when _manipulating_ strings (slicing, trimming, counting), i.e. operations that happen on a _character_ level rather than a _byte_ level."

So the next execution will appear fast because it is optimized, but then later executions (using _different_ parameters) will be slow again, because they are using the query plan that was cached for the previous parameter values. The _real_ problem is related to parameter sniffing."

  extended="git is more granular than mercurial =&gt; very beneficial in creating new types of workflows mercurial: heads/branches are inferred by lack of children git: branches are &quot;namespaced&quot; per remote. All heads are explicit. A tag or a branch points to a particular node in the graph, and there are tools to compare the changes between two nodes; allows private branches. mercurial: history is immutable / changing history is discouraged git: mutability is normal part of workflow mercurial, the branch name is stored in the changeset. Easy to have duplicate/conflicting branch names. the branch name is in the changeset, so the branch lives forever =&gt; discourages throw-away branches / experimentation. In git, a branch is just a head. Changing a branch actually moves the pointer to the new changeset (hash/commit). This head must be _explicitly_ shared across repositories. - won't accidentally push code you don't mean to. - no fear of name collisions. / hg cannot shallow clone."

  extended="monad: a design pattern. It says that whenever you have a class of functions that accept one type and return another type, there are two functions that can be applied across this class to make them composable: - 'bind' function: transforms any function to accept the same type as it returns, making it composable - 'unit' function: wraps a value in the type accepted by the composable functions. 'monad' pattern helps you spot accidental complexity: code that isn‚Äôt dealing directly with the problem at hand, but which is just glueing data types together."

Debugging distributed applications is as deterministic as predicting the weather. Jitter introduces more randomness because things tend to stack up. For example, cache expirations: If everything expires at one time this creates a thundering herd. To introduce &quot;jitter&quot; you might randomly expire between 18-30 hours. Each machine actually removes entropy from the system, so you have to add some back in. Cheating - Know How to Fake Data: The fastest function call is the one that doesn‚Äôt happen. A monotonically increasing counter, like movie view counts or profile view counts, could update by a random amount and as long as it changes from odd to even people would probably believe it‚Äôs real, and the actual transactions only need to happen occasionally."

No politician wanted to preside over a fare increase, so fares were kept artificially and unrealistically low for decades until the 70s, when there was finally a crisis. Should the dollar vans be fully legalized, and therefore regulated, we can expect politicians -- who are universally devoid both of economic knowledge and of business sense -- to replay the former history, so that Winston and his fellows will be bankrupt within 10 years of achieving legality."

  extended="Suppose I connect the ends of the string. All of a sudden, only certain vibrations make any sense on that string, because other wavelengths won't match up at the point where the string is connected together. We refer to this as a periodic boundary condition, that the value of the wave at x must be equal to the value of the wave at x+2pi. Now imagine the same thing all the way around the surface of a sphere. Start at any point, travel in any direction for one trip around the sphere, and the function has to return to the same value for the description to be logical. Then you can take another step and talk about the family of solutions on the surface of a sphere; in one case, the trivial one, there are no nodes, the whole sphere kind of &quot;breathes&quot; together. Then we introduce one equatorial node, the north pole vibrates out and the south pole vibrates in, and then the reverse. Then we add more and more nodes of vibration."

Do this for him for ~6 months, then take it off of your site for a while and then have him do the same for you. You do *not* want to simply cross link.Content and context is important. You want the SE's to associate the link with the text around it.Doing this with a few friends (or a network of your own sites) can be effective if you don't tip the scale to spam. Keep it interesting for humans - measure the human CTR on the links, remove-low preforming paragraphs and add new ones in their place to refine the process. This is not only valuable for your community but this keeps the white hat on and Google happy. You also want a good human CTR, e.g. 1000 clicks for every auto-change."

  extended="Nassim Taleb divides phenomena into two classes: Mediocristan, consisting of phenomena that fit the bell curve model, such as games of chance, height and weight in humans, and so on. Here future observations can be predicted by extrapolating from variations in statistics based on past observation (for example, sample means and standard deviations). Extremistan, consisting of phenomena that don't fit the bell curve model, such as the search queries, the stock market, the length of wars, and so on. Sometimes such phenomena can sometimes be modeled using power laws or fractal distributions, and sometimes not. In many cases, the very notion of a standard deviation is meaningless. The current generation of machine learning algorithms can work well in Mediocristan but not in Extremistan. The very metrics these algorithms use, such as precision, recall, and root-mean square error (RMSE), make sense only in Mediocristan."

Milk is fortified with synthetic vitamin D2, which is not nearly as potent as natural D3, which is used in most dietary supplements. A glass of milk provides only 100 IU (2.5 micrograms). Fifteen minutes of sun exposure to 40-percent of the body is suggested daily for fair-skinned individuals. mortality rates for melanoma rose steeply after sunscreens came into common use, not before. Sunscreen lotion blocks the vitamin D-producing UV-B rays, while allowing the deeper-penetrating, cancer-causing UV-A rays to burn the skin. Many health food stores stock 1000 IU vitamin D pills. Most multivitamins provide no more than 400 IU ."

Mobutu Sese Seko, ruler of Zaire for 32 years, who took the country as personal reward for &quot;liberating&quot; it. ... In India, the Gandhi family has towered over its democracy for 60 years. ... Henning Melber ... fought in Namibia against white rule. Watching his fellow liberators turn on their own people once the war was won...&quot;"
