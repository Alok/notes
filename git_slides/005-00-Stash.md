## dat stash
You can treat stash (e.g. `stash@{0}` is
first/topmost stash) as a _merge commit_--because
`stash@{0}` / `refs/stash` is a merge commit and we
must tell git _which_ parent we want to reference.

* First parent of a stash always contains the HEAD
  commit at time of stash.
* Second parent always contains the index at time of
  stash.
* [show gitk screenshot of the stash]

To checkout a stashed file:
    $ git checkout stash@{0} -- <filename>
