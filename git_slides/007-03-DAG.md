# Git data organization / What's in a repo?

* DAG
    * blobs: data files
    * trees: hierarchy records. They specify the
      structure of the blobs and how they connect to
      each other (like a database)
    * commits: snapshots of the _arrangement_ of the
      blobs on the trees
    * Some files (tags) hold metadata about the blobs
* *Config...*
* *Working copy...*
