## dat stash
You can treat stash (e.g. `stash@{0}` is first / topmost stash) as
a merge commit. Because `stash@{0}` / refs/stash is a merge commit,
and we have to tell git which parent we want to reference.

* The first parent of a stash always contains the HEAD commit at
  time of stash.
* The second parent always contains the index at time of stash.
* [show gitk screenshot of the stash]

To checkout a stashed file:
    $ git checkout stash@{0} -- <filename>
