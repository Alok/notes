Worst-case time of a hashtable lookup is bounded by the hash-collision strategy.
    - Linked-list is of course O(n)...
    - "Cuckoo hashing" offers constant-time lookup (_and_ insertion!)

open addressing: alternative to linked-list
   Double hashing: Unlike linear/quadratic probing, the interval depends on the
                   _data_, so collisions have different bucket sequences.
