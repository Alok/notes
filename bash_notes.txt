grep recursive glob filter for bash 3.x:
    grep -r --include=*.js foo .

grep recursive glob filter for bash 4+ with:
    shopt -s globstar
    grep -RHsn 'string' **/*.ext

    -H      Always print filename headers with output lines.
    -s      Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored.
    -n      Each output line is preceded by its line number relative to the file

conditionals
    Whitespace in conditional brackets is *required*.
        This will cause an error:
            ["$TERM" = ""] || echo ok
        This is correct:
            [ "$TERM" = "" ] || echo ok

    Whitespace also affects grouped {} commands.  http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Command-Grouping
    Best practice:
        - always inner-pad [ ... ] ( ... ) { ... } with whitespace.
        - always terminate groups ( ...; ) { ...; } with semicolon.

subshells and pipelines  http://stackoverflow.com/a/2188223/152142
    In a pipeline, all commands run concurrently (with their stdout/stdin connected by pipes)
    in different processes.

    Parentheses ( ...; ) create a subshell with its own temporary environment and scope.

    Braces { ...; } _group_ commands in the _current_ shell context. If that
    group is part of a pipeline, it runs in a separate process, like any other
    pipeline segment (http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/127346/14626).

    Examples:
        # concatenate 'date' and 'top'
        $ { date; top -b -n1 | head ; } > logfile

        # timestamp a build log
        $ { date; make 2>&1; date; } | tee logfile

"command" command
    Execute command, ignoring any function "shadow". (like `normal!` in Vim)

TOOLS:
    iftop
    iotop
    lsof "replaces ps and netstat"  http://danielmiessler.com/study/lsof/
        lsof -c tmux        see what files and network connections tmux is using
        losf /var/log/*     see everything that is interacting with /var/log/*

FAQ:
    you don't need to protect the end-of-line with a backslash if:
        - the line ends with the pipe symbol
        - you are in an unclosed string
